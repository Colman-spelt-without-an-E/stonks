# Algorithmic trading

## Introduction

Algorithmic trading is the act of trading on the stock market using automated computer algorithms. It offers many advantages as opposed to manual trading: no (less) human error, consistent, continuous monitoring and trading, sensitive, etc. As more forms of trading like cryptocurrency surface, trading is becoming more and more accessible to the common person. There is a fast-growing market for people who want to invest but do not have the time to learn about the technicalities to it, and so the idea of selling trading bots is conceived. 

In this project, different trading strategies are investigated (well, lightly, since I'm a maths student after all and I'm quite new to this) and a trading bot written in Python. (Again, since I'm very much a mathematician,) Detailed analysis is performed on said trading bot, and we compare it to other existing trading bots on the market. The final goal from then is to put our trading bot to test in the stock market. With real money. (Sigh... isn't this just sugarcoated gambling? How far have I fallen...)
